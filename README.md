# Modularization

The **Satellite Android** app has been fully modularized and you can find the detailed guidance and
description of the modularization strategy used in
[modularization guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization).

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, utilizing [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous operations.
- Convention plugin in Android is a Gradle plugin that defines common configurations and rules across the project, ensuring a consistent structure across all modules.
- Jetpack Libraries:
    - Jetpack Compose: Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for declarative UI development.
    - Lifecycle: Observes Android lifecycles and manages UI states upon lifecycle changes.
    - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and is lifecycle-aware, ensuring data survival through configuration changes.
    - Navigation: Facilitates screen navigation, complemented by [Hilt Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#hilt) for dependency injection.
    - Room: Constructs a database with an SQLite abstraction layer for seamless database access.
    - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): Facilitates dependency injection.
- Architecture:
    - MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model): Facilitates separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.
    - Repository Pattern: Acts as a mediator between different data sources and the application's business logic.
